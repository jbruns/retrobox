"Retrobox" is a purpose-built appliance aiming for highly accurate, low latency emulation of past generation game console, computer, and handheld hardware, driven via a 10-foot UI and controller input.

***Hardware suggestions:***
| 1080p                  | 4K                      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Intel Core i3-7350K    | Intel Core i7-8700      |
| NVIDIA GeForce 1050 Ti | NVIDIA GeForce 1060 6GB | 

* 16GB RAM
* local flash storage (boot, software, save states, ...)
* additional storage (local, NAS or cloud) for content

In general, lower core count/higher clock speed is preferred. Most emulators rely on single-thread performance, and thus it may also be wise to disable Hyperthreading (if supported by your CPU).

***Input:***

I personally prefer to use an accessory called "Bliss-Box" to act as a universal controller-to-USB interpreter. Any controller supported by Kodi or RetroArch should be fully supported here.
  
***Software suggestions:***
* To hide additonal aspects of the update and boot/shutdown UX, you'll need an Enterprise version of Windows 10 (LTSC or CB channels).
* RetroArch is used wherever possible. Due to forthcoming integration of libretro cores in Kodi 18, it may also be possible just to have Kodi act as your frontend, if so desired.

Emulation is not piracy, and please do not interpret the scripts here as an aid to promote or encourage piracy.
